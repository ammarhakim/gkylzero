Unit tests
----------

These are smaller tests that check specific components of gkylzero.

To create/run a new unit test:

1. Write and save your unit test file in this folder (with a `ctest_` prefix).
2. In the main directory re-compile the code.
3. Run the test's executable in `build/unit` (or in `cuda-build/unit` if running on GPU).
