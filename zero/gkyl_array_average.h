 * @param local Full range of the input array, covering all dimensions of the total basis.
 * @param local_avg Reduced range of the output array, covering only the non-averaged dimensions.
 * @param local_avg_ext Extended reduced range of the output array, used only to define the integrated weight.
 * @param weight Pointer to the array containing weight for the averaging process. (set it to NULL for integral)

 * @param use_gpu Boolean flag indicating whether the computation should be performed on a GPU.

/**
 * Create a new updater that computes the weighted average of a gkyl_array.
 * The average can be performed in a subset of the dimensions of the input array and is written generally as:
 * ```math
 *  \int f(x_k) w(x_i) dx^i / \int w(x_k) dx^i
 * ```
 * where $f(x_k)$ is the input array, $w(x_i)$ is the weight.
 * The input are arrays in the configuration space coordinates $\{x_k\}$ and the integral is performed over the dimensions $i$.
 * 
 * If no weighted average is required (weight = NULL), the method will compute the average of the input array, 
 * divided by the volume of the averaging space, i.e.:
 * ```math
 * \int f(x_i) dx^i / \int dx^i
 * ```
 * 
 * If a weight is provided the method will compute the weighted average in two steps:
 *  1. Compute the non-weighted average of the weight by a recursive call with weight = NULL, i.e.:
 *    ```math 
 *    A_w = \int w(x_i) dx^i / \int dx^i
 *    ```
 *  2. Compute the non-weighted average of the array multiplied by the weight, i.e.:
 *    ```math
 *    A_f = \int f(x_i) w(x_i) dx^i / \int dx^i
 *    ```
 *  3. Return the weighted average as:
 *    ```math
 *    A_f / A_w = \int f(x_i) w(x_i) dx^i / \int w(x_i) dx^i
 *    ```
